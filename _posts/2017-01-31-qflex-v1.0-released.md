title: QFlex v1.0 Released
---

Today we release the first version of QFlex (v1.0).

<!--more-->

QFlex allows running unmodified applications and operating systems for the 64-bit ARM architecture, and perform microarchitectural simulation. We also release an image of one of the CloudSuite benchmarks, [Data Caching][csdc], which you can use to start simulating right now. You can get QFlex from our [GitHub repo]({{ site.github.repo }}). As QFlex is a work in progress, we encourage users to use GitHub issues actively.
