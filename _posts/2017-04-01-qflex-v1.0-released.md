title: QFlex v1.0 Released
---

Today we release the first version of QFlex (v1.0).

<!--more-->

QFlex enables full-system microarchitectural simulation of multicores running unmodified applications and is based on QEMU. We currently support 64-bit ARM binaries in trace mode. In this first release, we also make a full CloudSuite workload image available for those who want to get a head start. More workload images will follow soon. You can download QFlex from our [GitHub repo]({{ site.github.repo }}). As QFlex is a work in progress, we encourage users to use GitHub issues actively.
