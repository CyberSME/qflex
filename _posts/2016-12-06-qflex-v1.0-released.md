---

Today we release the first version of QFlex (v1.0).

<!--more-->


QFlex allows running unmodified application and operating systems for the 64-bit ARM architecture, and perform microarchitectural analysis. We also release an image of Memcached running on Debian, which you can use to start simulating right now. You can get QFlex from our [GitHub repo]({{ site.github.repo }}). As QFlex is work in progress, we encourage users to use GitHub issues for requests for enhancements and bug fixes.
